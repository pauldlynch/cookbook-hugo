Hitherto, I haven't made any specific news updates for this site; a brief summary is in the [About](../../pages/about/) link.

Recently, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, I have been spending a healthy chunk of time converting from Jekyll to Hugo, and at the same time revising old recipes and adding new ones. There was quite a backlog of these new (not so new) recipes, which I hadn't added for a couple of years because of poor interactions between Jekyll, Jekyll updates, and my chosen Jekyll theme, which wasn't being updated. Problem solved, at least for now.

The updates to existing recipes involved some proof-reading, a little photography, and a lot of unit conversions.  Everything should be in a combination of metric and teaspoons (which are often more precise than cheap scales). American units are vague, annoying and make life difficult. As are so many other things.
