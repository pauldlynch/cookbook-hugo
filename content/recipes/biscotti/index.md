Adapted from [Rachel Roddy's Biscotti](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/20/rachel-roddys-recipe-for-hazelnut-biscotti).

Set oven to 180C.

Whisk 4 large eggs with 350g caster sugar until thick and creamy.

Add:
- 500g flour (the linked recipe asks for 400g, but that is very hard to handle)
- 150g toasted hazelnuts
- 2 tbs olive oil
- pinch of salt 
- 0.5 tsp baking powder
- 60g sultanas
- zest of one large orange

Mix and form into 2 x 20cm logs, then flatten into 10cm wide. The best way to do this is to pour out roughly the right amount onto a lined baking tray (I use a silicon mat), then shape with wet hands.

Bake for 25 mins.

Allow to cool until warm, turn down the oven to 160C. Slice 1cm thick.

Use the oven to dry them out for 7 mins per side. The ideal is a light brown and crisp biscuit.  Depending on the usual many factors, don't be afraid to repeat until the colour and crispness is right.
