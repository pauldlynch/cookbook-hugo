Originally from La Viña, San Sebastian, I took this recipe from [Bon Appetit]( https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/basque-burnt-cheesecake), which is reasonably close to the original.

Requires a 25cm (10”) springform pan.

- 2 lb/900g cream cheese
- 1.5 cups/300g sugar
- 6 large eggs
- 2 cups/480ml heavy cream
- 6g/1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup/40g plain flour

Heat oven to 400F/200C. Grease pan and line with parchment, 2x 20x30cm(16x12”) sheets, to at least 5cm (2”) above top of pan.  Crinkle it up.

Beat cream cheese and sugar to smooth (2 mins on medium/low).

Add eggs one at a time on medium. Back to med/low, add cream, salt and vanilla.

Turn off and sift in flour. As I had small lumps left in mine after stirring in, it might be worth putting through a fine sieve into the lined pan.

Put in pan, bake 60-65 minutes.  Top should be deep caramel colour, but still very jiggly.

Cool, unfold, serve.
