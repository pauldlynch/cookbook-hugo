Recipe from Richard Bertinet's Dough. Makes 10 - 15 scones.

- 150g butter (salted, or add a small pinch of salt)
- 600g plain flour
- 150g caster sugar
- 40g baking powder
- 280g sultanas
- 190ml double cream
- 190ml milk
- 1 egg for egg wash

Rub in butter and flour to the texture of breadcrumbs. Stir well in the sugar and baking powder, then the sultanas.

Add the cream and milk, and mix to bring together into a dough. 

On a lightly floured work surface, lightly press flat, fold in half, press flat again, then fold and press again in the opposite direction. This should end up in a squarish shape, rather like a thick book. Lightly flour, cover and leave in a cool place for 15 minutes.

Heat the oven to 220C (non-fan).

Roll out into a rectangle about 3cm thick, and use a sharp knife to divide into 6cm squares. Reshape any offcuts into more squares. Place on a baking tray or two, well spaced. Brush with the egg wash, wait 2 minutes and brush again.  

Put in the 220C oven and turn down to 200C. Bake for 20 minutes, until nicely golden.

Serve with generous quantities of clotted cream and the very best strawberry jam.
