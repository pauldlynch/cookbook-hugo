Based on: [Felicity Cloake's Perfect Shortbread](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/sep/30/how-to-make-perfect-shortbread).

Quantities doubled to suit the baking tray; makes 20 - 24 fingers.

Set the oven to 150C.  Line with greaseproof paper one of those half baking trays with a raised edge (1cm).

- 230g room temperature butter
- 110g caster sugar

Beat together until smooth.
￼
Sift and add:

- 260g plain flour
- 80g rice flour/fine semolina
- Good pinch of salt

Bring together as a dough, wrap and put into fridge for 15 minutes.  Roll out to fit the baking tray.  Dust with a little caster sugar (optional), and prick with a fork in a traditional pattern.

Bake 1 hour to light golden, no darker.  

This is enough to make a block 22 x 15 x 2cm; this thickness makes shortbread fingers, rather than shortbread biscuits. It will be easier to lay out before chilling, but will still be crumbly at that point. This size is half of a medium baking tray; you can form it on a baking sheet if required, as it won’t spread. It is best to cut into fingers while still warm; cool first in the baking tray for 10 minutes as it is very crumbly out of the oven.
