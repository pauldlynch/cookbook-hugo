From [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/06/old-fashioned-flaky-pie-dough-recipe.html). I use this for cherry pie.  Takes about 20-30 minutes, plus 2hr+ chill time.

- 225g plain flour
- 12g sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt (4g)
- 225g unsalted butter, cut into 1/2” cubes
- 120ml cold water

Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt.

Stir in the butter, then flatten each cube between your fingers.  Make sure it stays cold - < 20C.

Stir in the water gradually; it may not all be needed.  A slightly wet, ragged dough is the objective.

Roll out to a 25cm x 38cm (10” x 15”) rectangle.  Fold the edges to the centre, then fold in half twice, along different axes.  Cut into two blocks (one a little larger than the other), wrap in cling film, and chill.

For a 23cm (9”) double crust, roll out one half to a 36cm circle and drape over the pie plate.  Put down a layer of greaseproof paper.  Roll the second half to 36cm as well.  Put on top of the paper, cover with cling film, and chill.  Suggested is 2 hrs to overnight (I have cheated and done 30 mins with no ill effects).
