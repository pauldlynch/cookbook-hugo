The origin of this, I believe, is the Joy of Cooking.

Preheat oven to 180C.

**Prepare streusel and set aside:**

- 100g plain flour
- 165g soft light brown sugar
- 100g chopped walnuts or pecans 
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 90g butter, melted

**Whisk together thoroughly and set aside:**

- 300g plain flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

**Combine in another bowl and set aside:**

- 300ml sour cream (300 ml)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**In a large bowl, beat on high speed until lightened in colour and texture, 3-4 minutes:**

- 60g softened (but not oily) butter 
- 200g caster sugar

**Beat in one at a time:**

- 2 large eggs

Add the flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the sour cream mixture in 2 parts (therefore it goes 1/3 flour, 1/2 sour cream, 1/3 flour, 1/2 sour cream, 1/3 flour), beating on low speed and scraping the sides as necessary.  Spread into a greased and lined 33 x 23cm (13"x9") pan; the cake is quite delicate, so the lining can be used like a sling to lift it out.  I squeeze the streusel to form small clumps, then sprinkle over the batter, starting with the edges.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Serve warm!  Although it gets better when left for a day.
