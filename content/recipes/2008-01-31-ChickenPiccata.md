title: Chicken Piccata
---

Taken from Gordon Ramsay.  The more traditional variation is described at the bottom.

- 4 skinned chicken breasts
- 200 ml white wine
- 2 tbs capers, rinsed and squeezed
- 200 ml chicken stock
- 100 ml creme fraiche
- garlic (can use half a head cut across to expose the bulbs)
- rosemary sprig

Flatten the chicken breasts - put then in a plastic bag and roll firmly with a rolling pin.

Heat some oil/butter in a saut√© pan and heat the garlic and rosemary in it for 2 minutes.

Fry the breasts for about 2 minutes on each side, until lightly browned on the outside.  Remove the breasts and put on one side; discard the garlic and rosemary.  Add the wine and stock and turn up the heat to deglaze and reduce a little (ie, to half).  Add the capers and cream; season.  Bubble this for a couple of minutes, and return the chicken to the pan.

Dress with parsley and serve.  Plain rice or pasta goes well with this, as will baby new potatoes.

## Variation
You can dress with chopped parsley; can thicken with flour at the start instead of the cream; can add the juice of half a lemon.  Can also use half an onion softened in the oil after browning the chicken.
