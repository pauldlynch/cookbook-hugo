This one comes from Mary Berry, and produces an exquisitely rich and
squishy brownie.

- 340g/12 oz dark chocolate, high cocoa content preferred
- 225g/8 oz butter

Put this in a bowl and melt over a saucepan of boiling water.  Then
add a small shot of espresso (2 tsp instant coffee and 2 tbs hot water
if you can't manage an espresso).  Allow to cool a little before the
next stage.

- 3 large eggs
- 225g/8 oz caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla essence

beat well together, then mix into the cooled chocolate mixture.

- 85g/3 oz self raising flour 
- 170g/6 oz walnut or pecan pieces
- 225g/8 oz plain chocolate chips or chunks

Fold these into the mixture, and pour out into a well greased 12" x 9"
baking or roasting tray.  You can line the tray with oiled greaseproof
paper if the surface isn't perfect.

Cook for 30-40 minutes at 160C.  You need to keep a close eye on this,
as the brownies can easily overcook; they must come out when the
middle is still gooey, but the surface should have formed a dull
crust.  As they cool they will continue to cook, and dry brownies are
nowhere near as pleasant as gooey ones - so err on the side of
caution.

Allow to cool, then cut into squares or slices and turn out.  4 x 4
seems to work; any smaller is just mean.
