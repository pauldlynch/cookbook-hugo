{{< figure src="./IMG_0984.jpeg" title="No knead bread" >}}

- 400g flour, plain or bread (3 cups)
- 8g / 1.25 tsp salt
- 1g / 0.25 tsp yeast
- 300g water (1 1/3 cups) 75% hydration

Mix, allow to rest/rise for 12-18 hrs; it will be ready when the surface has small bubbles.  

Turn out and fold a couple of times, then cover and rest for 15 minutes. Shape into a ball and transfer to a well floured tea towel and cover with another tea towel (or just fold over your original tea towel if it is large enough), prove for 1 - 2 hrs. Use finger prod test to check when ready. 

Preheat oven & casserole 15-30 mins to 250C/475F. Bake for 30 mins covered, + 15-30 mins uncovered.
