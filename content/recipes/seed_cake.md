This is a very traditional British tea cake, and I've been making it since university (as it was very cheap to make!). I'll reference [this](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/02/nigel-slater-classic-recipe-seed-cake) recipe from Nigel Slater, but it appears to be almost identical to the one from Delia Smith.

- 120g butter
- 120g caster sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 170g SR flour
- 50g ground almonds
- 2 tsp caraway seeds
- 2 tbs milk

Heat the oven to 160C. Line a 20cm x 9 cm x 7cm loaf tin (greaseproof paper, or the traditional smear of butter with a dusting of flour).

Cream the butter and sugar, then beat in the eggs.  Mix in the rest of the ingredients.  Bake for 1 hour.
