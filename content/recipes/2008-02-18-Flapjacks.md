- 150 g unsalted butter
- 75 g light borne or demarara sugar
- 3 tbs golden syrup
- 250 g rolled oats
- 1 tsp ground ginger (optional)

melt butter and stir in sugar and syrup, then oats and ginger.

Press into a 20cm square tin, or equivalent baking tray.

Bake for 20-25 mins at 180C/375F/gas mark 5 until golden at the edges.
Cool for 15 mins, and slice.

You could vary the size of oats, and consider mixing a proportion of
oatmeal instead of up to 50% of the oats. Another option is to use
muesli/granola instead of some of the oats.
