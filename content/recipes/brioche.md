This recipe is adapted from Richard Bertinet's recipe in Crust. The shopping list is very attractive in its simplicity: 500g flour, 1 250g block of butter and six eggs (plus a little sugar, yeast and salt).

- 500g strong white flour
- 50g caster sugar
- 1 sachet (7g) yeast
- 10g salt
- 350g eggs (== 6 large, approx)

Mix dry ingredients, then add eggs and combine well.  Continue until it starts to become less sticky.

- 250g unsalted butter, cold, cut into small cubes (1cm or less).

Add butter and work until smooth, silky and elastic. I haven’t timed it, but I’d guess about a total of 15 minutes for both phases in a stand mixer (that’s the non Bertinet part). Need to keep to slow, so as to avoid overheating the dough.

Put onto lightly dusted work surface, and shape into a ball. Put back into bowl, let rest for 2 hours.

Repeat (turn out, stretch, shape into ball, put back in bowl).

Leave in cool place for 12-14 hours (larder, not fridge, depending on temperature).

Divide into 15 70g balls, shape, allow to prove for about one hour, and freeze. (Or: let rise 2.5 hours, then bake)

Take out from freezer as required, leave overnight to “rise”, then bake for 12 minutes at 190C. May need a couple of minutes further to brown the underside, depending on your baking tins.

If combined to make two small loaves, after ten minutes turn down to 180C for another 25-30 mins.
