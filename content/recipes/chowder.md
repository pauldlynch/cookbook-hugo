Adapted from [Nigel Slater](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/16/quick-fish-chowder-nigel-slater-recipe)

- onion / leek
- 500ml water & 500 ml milk
- 400g new potatoes (or waxy potatoes, cut into chunks)
- 400g mixed fish (I dislike salmon in this, but any white or smoked fish is good)
- large handful of frozen sweetcorn
- 2 spring onions, sliced
- parsley, chopped

Soften onion/leek in butter and season with salt and pepper.  Add liquid & potatoes.  When soft, add fish, cook for 10 minutes.  Add corn, spring onions and parsley.  Serve when corn is tender.

Can garnish with dill or tarragon.
