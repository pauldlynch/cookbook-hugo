- 100g fortified wine - anything at all, including liqueurs... creme de cassis?
- 30g gelatine (powder or leaf, 200-240 bloom)
- 135g fructose
- 135g corn syrup
- 75g ? cornstarch (this is to dust the finished gummies; an equal mix of cornstarch and icing sugar would also be good)

Also needed: a sous vide set up, a silicone mould for making chocolates, and a squeezy bottle, of the sort you can get from restaurant suppliers.

Makes about 36 small gummies.

Set the sous vide to 75C.

Put the fortified wine in a bowl.  Pour gelatine over it (assuming powder; for sheets, follow instructions).  Mix quickly.  rest for one minute.

Mix the corn syrup and fructose in another bowl.  Put mix in a 470ml (1 US pt) mason jar.  Add the gelatine/wine mix.

Sous vide for 1 hour.

Stir to mix fully, rest for 15 mins.  Put in squeeze bottle, fill the moulds.  Leave 4 hours to overnight to set. Dust with cornstarch (and/or icing sugar).
