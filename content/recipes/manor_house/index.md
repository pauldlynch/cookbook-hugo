There are many attempt to imitate the [Mr Kipling's Manor House Fruit Cake](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6KDNvE0p174); this is mine.

- 225g self raising flour
- 110g butter
- 110g caster sugar
- 1 tsp mixed spice
- 225g mixed dried fruit (with or without peel; I prefer with)
- 5 tbs milk
- 1 egg
- Demerara sugar

Set oven to 180C.

Mix flour and butter to breadcrumbs (best done in a food processor, but rubbing in by hand is traditional).  Mix in the spice, sugar and fruit. Mix in egg and add milk to reach a dropping consistency. Can turn out into a mixing bowl and use a spoon.

Put in a greased and lined loaf tin or 6‚Äù round tin (15cm), sprinkle with about two tablespoons of Demerara sugar. Bake for 1 hour; check after 45 mins and cover if it is getting too dark.

## Variations
All of these variations start out rather crumbly, and better on the second day. This might be corrected by adding more egg.

For date and walnut cake: switch the sugar to golden caster; replace the mixed fruit with 125g chopped dates and 115g chopped walnuts. Bake at 180C fan, done at 45 mins.
