Jay Rayner's pork, chorizo and butter bean stew. From his book and road tour, “The Ten (Food) Commandments”.

*Serves 6*

- 6 chorizo cooking sausages, in 1cm slices
- olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1.5 kg braising pork, cubed
- 400g tin tomatoes
- 750ml chicken stock
- 400g tin butter beans

Heat oven to 150C.

Heat oil and sauté onion to soft.  Cook 2/3 the chorizo. Brown the pork in the oil in small batches.  

Add tomatoes and stock, then remaining chorizo and strained butter beans.  Place in oven for 2 hours.  It is done when the pork shreds with a fork.  The liquid may need further reducing on the top of the stove; it always does when I do it.

If the chorizo is mild, add chillis or chilli flakes to taste.

I normally use either shoulder steaks, or a mix of shoulder steaks and belly strips for the pork (which would each be around 750g), and one pack (190g) of Waitrose cooking chorizo to the above measures of tomato, onion and beans.
