{{< figure src="./image.jpeg" title="Quick Coffee Cake" >}}

Originally from [America's Test Kitchen](https://atkfamily.com/recipes/easy-coffee-cake/).

Makes two 23cm cakes, each serving 6. Do not try to put all of the batter into one large cake pan because it will bake very unevenly.

## Ingredients

### Topping

- 65g light brown sugar
- 65g granulated sugar
- 50g all-purpose flour
- 60g unsalted butter, softened 
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 115g pecans or walnuts, chopped coarse

### Cake

- 425g plain flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 440ml sour cream (440ml)
- 200g light brown sugar
- 200g granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 105g unsalted butter, melted and cooled

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 180C, and grease two 23cm cake pans.
2. The topping: mix the sugars, flour, butter, and cinnamon together with a quick couple of pulses in a food processor (or by hand) until the mixture resembles wet sand. Stir in the pecans and set aside.
3. The cake: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk the sour cream, sugars, eggs, and melted butter together until smooth. Gently fold the egg mixture into the flour mixture until smooth (do not overmix).
4. Scrape the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the top of both cakes.
5. Bake until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out with just a few crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking. Let the cakes cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes before serving.
