Modified from Delia's Book of Cakes.
### Dry Ingredients  
- 340g/12 oz plain flour
- 1\.5 tsp ground ginger
- 2 level tsp cinnamon
- 1/8 nutmeg, grated
### Raising Agent  
- 1 level tsp bicarb (baking soda)
- 60ml/4 tbs milk
### Wet Ingredients  
- 170g/6 oz treacle
- 170g/6 oz golden syrup
- 170g/6 oz dark brown soft sugar
- 170g/6 oz butter
- 150ml/5 fl oz water
- 2 eggs
  
Set oven to 170C.

Sift flour and spices.  Mix bicarb into the milk in a separate
container.  Put treacle, syrup, sugar and butter with 150ml water
into a medium saucepan and heat till the butter is melted and it is
all well mixed.

Mix the melted ingredients into the flour mix.  Beat in the eggs, then
finally the milk/bicarb.  It's OK to use an electric mixer for this,
especially if the flour has formed lumps in the mix.  The bicarb will
start reacting as soon as it is added, so leave this to last, and put
into the tin and the oven as soon as the bicarb mix is in: don't let
it hang around.  It is  contact with the treacle that causes the
reaction.

Put into a greased and lined 2 lb loaf tin.  Bake for 75 - 90 minutes
at 170 C until done - the top will be springy to touch, and the sides
will have come away slightly from the tin.

This recipe makes a little too much mixture for the recommended tin.
I would suggest putting 2/3 the amount into the same tin, and using
the rest in a small baking tray or small loaf tin, perhaps.  It would
work in a deep 20cm/8" round cake tin, but is too much for an 20cm/8" 
square tin! If you want to have two same sized cakes, you can use two 1 lb loaf tins (mine are from the 70s!), but best to reduce the cooking time by 10-15 minutes.
