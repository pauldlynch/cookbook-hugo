{{< figure src="./IMG_1161.jpeg" title="Date And Walnut Cake">}}

- 225g dates, chopped (best not medjool, they are too squishy)
- 1 tsp baking soda (aka bicarbonate of soda or sodium bicarbonate)
- 85g butter, melted
- 85g caster sugar
- 120ml water, hot (or tea)
- 1 egg
- 85g walnuts (use walnut halves and roughly chop them)
- 225g self raising flour

Put the dates, bicarb, butter and sugar in a large bowl and pour over the hot water.  Mix well and leave until cool.

Set the oven to 150C fan (or 170C), and line a 2lb loaf tin.

Mix in the egg, then the walnuts. Finally add the flour and mix well. Put the mixture in the loaf tin and bake for 1 hr.  Allow to cool; this cake keeps well.
